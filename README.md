- **PROJECT #1: “WRITE”**

    You can loosely think of this project as “Teach Someone to Be You”. With this project, you will be pushed to unravel the parameters of your idea of “self-portrait” and to think in multiple directions and media about what it means to represent yourself in the context of the people and environments around you. This project is about representation. We ask students to take themselves, or their persona, as the subject of representation. The student has two primary challenges:
    - To take the opportunity to consider what self-hood is and to use an art medium to help them discover ways to articulate that self-hood.

- **PROJECT #2: “REWRITE”**
    **Materiality - ​​“Remake” that object in such a way that it is transformed**

    Take multiple photographs of an object that you treasure and have strong feelings about. In your photography, you should seek to render the object so that it’s unfamiliar, perhaps not even recognizable as itself - thinking about questions of scale, context, focus, point of view, etc. Consider how your photographs of this object may already affect its meaning, and/or your feelings about it. You’ll bring prints of these photographs to class.

    Observing your photographs, and what new views and understandings they might offer of your object, REMAKE that object in such a way that it is transformed.  This project will ask you to explore questions of appropriation, interpretation and translation. You will likely find yourself thinking about copying, duplicating, improving, distorting, disorienting, repairing.

    As you begin to conduct your artistic investigation, think about the spaces in which meaning is lodged in your object and how you can reference or disrupt those. Do you want to keep the materials consistent but reconfigure them into different forms? Can you keep the “meaning” of an object intact when you change the materials? What would it look like to turn a painting into a performance, or a video into a sculpture? What would it look like to animate an installation? How much of our voices can migrate between different contexts and different bodies without surrendering their original power? Conversely, how can we add our unique voices to existing work in a way that both adds new meaning and respects the original source?

- **PROJECT#3: DISTRIBUTE**

    What happens when a work leaves the hands of its creator and interfaces with a larger audience? Create an artwork drawing your OWN UNIQUE and specific interests and affinities, and from research you’ve done into that subject. The only constraint about this work is that it cannot be a unique and discrete object or image.

    The work has to be distributable in SOME specific WAY that makes sense for what the work IS. Modes for “distribution” could potentially include a public performance, a zine workshop, a website, a billboard ... think about how distribution begins something new, and how the material aids in that beginning. We’ll think together through what it means to package, translate, share and disseminate an idea, from the position of both the “maker” and the “receiver” of knowledge.for example, if it's a website, how will you track how many views it has or can you create a method for viewers to respond to the work? In all cases, document the work so that you can submit it as attached images and descriptions.
