- **PROJECT #1: “WRITE”**

    You can loosely think of this project as “Teach Someone to Be You”. With this project, you will be pushed to unravel the parameters of your idea of “self-portrait” and to think in multiple directions and media about what it means to represent yourself in the context of the people and environments around you. This project is about representation. We ask students to take themselves, or their persona, as the subject of representation. The student has two primary challenges:
    - To take the opportunity to consider what self-hood is and to use an art medium to help them discover ways to articulate that self-hood.

- **PROJECT #2: “REWRITE”**
    **Materiality - ​​“Remake” that object in such a way that it is transformed**

    Take multiple photographs of an object that you treasure and have strong feelings about. In your photography, you should seek to render the object so that it’s unfamiliar, perhaps not even recognizable as itself - thinking about questions of scale, context, focus, point of view, etc. Consider how your photographs of this object may already affect its meaning, and/or your feelings about it. You’ll bring prints of these photographs to class.

    Observing your photographs, and what new views and understandings they might offer of your object, REMAKE that object in such a way that it is transformed.  This project will ask you to explore questions of appropriation, interpretation and translation. You will likely find yourself thinking about copying, duplicating, improving, distorting, disorienting, repairing.

    As you begin to conduct your artistic investigation, think about the spaces in which meaning is lodged in your object and how you can reference or disrupt those. Do you want to keep the materials consistent but reconfigure them into different forms? Can you keep the “meaning” of an object intact when you change the materials? What would it look like to turn a painting into a performance, or a video into a sculpture? What would it look like to animate an installation? How much of our voices can migrate between different contexts and different bodies without surrendering their original power? Conversely, how can we add our unique voices to existing work in a way that both adds new meaning and respects the original source?

- **PROJECT#3: DISTRIBUTE**

    What happens when a work leaves the hands of its creator and interfaces with a larger audience? Create an artwork drawing your OWN UNIQUE and specific interests and affinities, and from research you’ve done into that subject. The only constraint about this work is that it cannot be a unique and discrete object or image.

    The work has to be distributable in SOME specific WAY that makes sense for what the work IS. Modes for “distribution” could potentially include a public performance, a zine workshop, a website, a billboard ... think about how distribution begins something new, and how the material aids in that beginning. We’ll think together through what it means to package, translate, share and disseminate an idea, from the position of both the “maker” and the “receiver” of knowledge.for example, if it's a website, how will you track how many views it has or can you create a method for viewers to respond to the work? In all cases, document the work so that you can submit it as attached images and descriptions.

- Mini Project #1 - Self As Collage

    Considering any aspects of your SELF that you want to embrace, explore or reflect on at this moment, create a collage self-portrait on paper that responds to the prompt: "I AM..."
    You may use a technique of bricolage by working with any odd assortment of materials you have at hand, or use materials you are comfortable with that give you pleasure to work with. How does your collage challenge a single story, and/or represent multiple parts of yourself or your history? How does your collage engage with time and place? Take this in whatever direction is pleasurable to you...your self-portrait might be realistic, abstract, funny, searching, contemplative, fractured, confused, empowering...etc.

- Mini-Project #2: Ephemeral Art

    In this project you will act as collector, sculptor and photographer. Choose an outdoor location in your environment and pay attention to the colors, shapes and objects present in this natural world. (If you are free to do so, you may also choose an outdoor location like a park, beach or forest further from your familiar surroundings.)  Spend some time gathering natural materials from this environment (twigs, dirt, rocks, shells, leaves...) and arrange them in whatever way feels visually satisfying or pleasurable to you. 

    Don’t feel rushed, take your time. Consider elements such as composition, color, contrast. You can go as miniature or as large as you like.  Take a photo of your ephemeral land art and upload the image to BCourses. 

- Mini Project #3 - SF MOMA Sketch and Describe Your Sensory Experience 

    Walk through the entire museum. Don't read any text. Don't linger in front of any work for more than 5 seconds. Look at everything, and note down which works you'd like to spend more time with. Choose one of the works you were attracted to, and go back to it and look at it curiously. If there is wall text, do not read it yet. This part may take you up to 15-20 or so minutes, depending on you.

    - First let yourself take in a sensory experience of the work. Practice paying close attention to the work. Meet it, greet it. Encounter it. Look up close, look from far away. Move around it. Close your eyes. Open them again. Look at the center, (if it has one) look at the edges. Crouch down and look up at it from a new angle. Unfocus your eyes. Look away. Where is it? How is it? What materials is it made from? What are its colors, textures, sounds, shapes, symbols? Do you want to touch it? If so, what do you think makes you want to touch it?  What does this work remind you of? What do you feel like when you’re with it?
    - Next, make a quick sketch of the piece in your notebook. Annotate your sketch-noting the impressions, feelings, thoughts, details that you noticed in the work. 
    - Finally, read the wall label for the work.  Note the name of the artist, the date and materials of the work.  What historical (prior art or artists, events, etc.) or other ideas did the wall label make you aware of that you may not have noticed in the work?  Make a quick drawing in your sketchbook of the work. Then, if you have a camera/phone, take some pictures of it - and think about how you choose to photograph it: what do you want to convey about this work in your photos? Details of areas? Texture? Shape? Size? Materials? 

- Mini Project #4 - Psychogeography

    Go to a place you would not usually go. Ideally, this should be a place that is not part of your routine, that feels unfamiliar to you in some way, and potentially a place where you might feel yourself as an outsider in some way. In this space, you could be an outsider physically, culturally, socially, politically … we all have different contexts in which we will feel ‘other’.

    Spend some time in this place. Don’t just enter and leave, but really walk around, observe, sit, listen. Avoid getting on your phone - if possible turn it off for a designated time. Use your senses: look at people; investigate the smells, sounds, textures, colors. What details do you notice about this place, as well as your own presence within it? To what extent do you feel a part of, or an outsider to this place? What does your experience say about the "location" from which you see/sense/think/feel. Take your sketchbook/ sheet of paper to make note of your observations.
