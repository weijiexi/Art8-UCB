# Lecture 6 Modernism
## MODERNISM
- There are many modernisms, each developing in different regions, and
with different timelines (for example Chinese modernism, Indian
modernism, Mexican modernism, etc.).
- When you hear the term modernism by itself, it usually means
European modernism (or perhaps EuroAmerican modernism, i.e. North
American modernism derived from its earlier forms in Europe).
- However, even the term ‘European modernism’ is misleading, since it
developed during the period of extensive colonization and was formed
in relation to, and extracting from its colonies.

#### Let’s consider the period of ‘European modernism’: 1860s – 1960s
- Industrialization:
- First Industrial Revolution: 1760s
- Second Industrial Revolution: 1850s
    - Growth of cities; large-scale factories; inventions of the cotton gin, sheet glass, steam
    power, cement, iron, steel, gas lighting, building of ships, railways, and roads;
    - Changes in social relations, ending of feudal systems, and growth of a middle-class,
    wider patronage of the arts;
    - inventions in photography (Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1922/26; Louis-Jacques-Mandé
    Daguerre (glass plate), 1839; William Henry Fox Talbot (paper negative), 1839...);
    - invention of paint tubes (1841);
    - Scientific inventions and changing ideas;
    - The spread of secular thought;
