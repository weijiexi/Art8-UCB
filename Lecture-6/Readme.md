# Lecture 6 Modernism
## MODERNISM
- There are many modernisms, each developing in different regions, and
with different timelines (for example Chinese modernism, Indian
modernism, Mexican modernism, etc.).
- When you hear the term modernism by itself, it usually means
European modernism (or perhaps EuroAmerican modernism, i.e. North
American modernism derived from its earlier forms in Europe).
- However, even the term ‘European modernism’ is misleading, since it
developed during the period of extensive colonization and was formed
in relation to, and extracting from its colonies.
#### Let’s consider the period of ‘European modernism’: 1860s – 1960s
- Industrialization:
- First Industrial Revolution: 1760s
- Second Industrial Revolution: 1850s
    - Growth of cities; large-scale factories; inventions of the cotton gin, sheet glass, steam
    power, cement, iron, steel, gas lighting, building of ships, railways, and roads;
    - Changes in social relations, ending of feudal systems, and growth of a middle-class,
    wider patronage of the arts;
    - inventions in photography (Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1922/26; Louis-Jacques-Mandé
    Daguerre (glass plate), 1839; William Henry Fox Talbot (paper negative), 1839...);
    - invention of paint tubes (1841);
    - Scientific inventions and changing ideas;
    - The spread of secular thought;
#### Let’s reconsider the formation of ‘European modernism’ in relation to and as extractive from its colonies:
- Industrialization:
    -  Wealth developed from slavery;
    -  Wealth developed from raw materials from colonies;
    -  Industrialization concentrated in Europe by de-industrializing other regions (through
    taxes, removal of raw materials, trade treaties, sanctions, wars)
    -  Development of shipping industries;
    -  Growth of port cities connected to shipping (gold, silver, slaves, cotton, spices, ores,
    wood, etc);
    -  Migration to port cities and across seas;
    -  Wealth used to create museums to house and display colonial artefacts;
    -  Wider patronage of the arts, museums and salons to display art to the public;
    -  Artists traveling to different colonized countries (Gauguin, Pechstein, Matisse, ...)
    -  Artists gaining access to artefacts from around the world (Rousseau, Picasso...)
#### Societal changes create different social ideas, understandings, and desires:
- The rise of the middle classes (the bourgeoisie);
- theories of social relations through economies:
    - Adam Smith (The Wealth of Nations, 1776, capitalism and the division of labor)
    - Karl Marx (Das Kapital, 1867-1883, analysis of capital and development of communism and socialism)
- theories of social relations through biology (Charles Darwin, On the Origin of
Species,1859);
- theories of social relations through psychology (Sigmund Freud: psychoanalysis,
dreams, repression, the unconscious, sexuality, the Id, Ego, etc)
