# Lecture2 NeoClassicism
Neoclassicism was an 18th- and early 19th-century cultural movement that emerged as a reaction to the ornate excesses of Baroque and Rococo styles. Rooted in the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, order, and moral virtue, it drew inspiration from the art, architecture, and ideals of ancient Greece and Rome. Here's a structured overview:

Robert Duncanson, American, Landscape with Rainbow, 1859
 - What do you see (first impressions), from the overall image to small details?
    First Impressions
    - Tranquil grandeur: A serene, luminous landscape bathed in golden light, with a sweeping rainbow bridging stormy clouds and sunlit fields.
    - Harmony vs. tension: Contrast between the darkened, brooding sky (left) and the radiant, fertile valley (right) creates a dynamic balance.
    - Human-nature symbiosis: Small figures and a cabin nestle into the land, suggesting peaceful coexistence with the untamed wilderness.

 - What are the “representational” elements–trees, figures, buildings, sky, ground, etc.–as well as the “abstract” elements–color, tone, light, line, shape, texture, etc?
- How do you put those details together towards speculative, narrative observations, like:
- Where is this?
- Continent, country, state or region; how would you describe the landscape?
- When is this?
- Era, century, decade?
- Season, time of year?
- Time of day?
- Who are the people
- Age; race; gender; class; occupation?
- What do other elements tell us?
    - 1. Is there a perspective to that representation, and if so, who is looking?
    - 2. Who does it represent?
    - 3. Whose viewpoints do we not see?
    - 4. What ideas or histories does the work represent?
- Does what you see tell you anything about the artist?
