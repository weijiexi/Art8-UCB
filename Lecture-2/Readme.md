# Lecture2 NeoClassicism
Neoclassicism was an 18th- and early 19th-century cultural movement that emerged as a reaction to the ornate excesses of Baroque and Rococo styles. Rooted in the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, order, and moral virtue, it drew inspiration from the art, architecture, and ideals of ancient Greece and Rome. Here's a structured overview:
## The Idea of the Classical, and its transformation in American Landscape Painting

Robert Duncanson, American, Landscape with Rainbow, 1859
 - 1.What do you see (first impressions), from the overall image to small details?
    First Impressions
    - Tranquil grandeur: A serene, luminous landscape bathed in golden light, with a sweeping rainbow bridging stormy clouds and sunlit fields.
    - Harmony vs. tension: Contrast between the darkened, brooding sky (left) and the radiant, fertile valley (right) creates a dynamic balance.
    - Human-nature symbiosis: Small figures and a cabin nestle into the land, suggesting peaceful coexistence with the untamed wilderness.
 - 2.What are the “representational” elements–trees, figures, buildings, sky, ground, etc.–as well as the “abstract” elements–color, tone, light, line, shape, texture, etc?

    Representational Elements
- Landscape:
    - Foreground: Rolling hills, a meandering stream, lush greenery, and a lone tree leaning toward the light.
     - Middle ground: A shepherd with sheep and a farmer guiding oxen near a rustic cabin.
    - Background: Jagged mountains under a dramatic sky, with a rainbow arcing over the scene.
    - Figures: Rural laborers (likely Black or working-class settlers) tending livestock and land.
    - Architecture: A modest wooden cabin, blending into the environment.

    Abstract Elements
- Color: Warm golds and greens dominate the sunlit valley, contrasting with cool grays and blues in the stormy sky. The rainbow’s prismatic hues soften this divide.
- Light: Divine, almost theatrical illumination highlights the valley, symbolizing hope and renewal.
- Line/Shape: Diagonal lines (rainbow, leaning tree) guide the eye from darkness to light; organic shapes evoke natural harmony.
- Texture: Soft, blended brushwork in the sky vs. detailed foliage and craggy mountains.


- How do you put those details together towards speculative, narrative observations, like:
- Where is this?
- Continent, country, state or region; how would you describe the landscape?
- When is this?
- Era, century, decade?
- Season, time of year?
- Time of day?
- Who are the people
- Age; race; gender; class; occupation?
- What do other elements tell us?
    - 1. Is there a perspective to that representation, and if so, who is looking?
    - 2. Who does it represent?
    - 3. Whose viewpoints do we not see?
    - 4. What ideas or histories does the work represent?
- Does what you see tell you anything about the artist?
