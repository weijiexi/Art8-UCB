# Lecture 4 American Indian Art
- Since 1940, many Native artists have pushed, pressed, and expanded beyond narrow, market-
driven definitions of American Indian art. Drawing from the National Museum of the American
Indian’s rich permanent collection, Stretching the Canvas presents nearly 40 paintings that
transcend, represent, or subvert conventional ideas of authenticity.
#### Keeping in mind some of the conventions of landscape and portraiture that we have looked at, how would you apply the questions from this list to a work by Wendy Red Star, Kent Monkman, or James Luna?
#### What other questions or perspectives do any of the Indigenous artists we looked at bring to landscape, portraiture, and history?

The most notable sitter in the foreground is the Miss Chief Eagle Testicle. She has a solid male body and female ornamental features indicating indigenous gender identity. Monkman believes that he created a character from an indigenous perspective to represent the indigenous 'gender traditions. The pose of Miss Chief Eagle Testicle represents her powerful self by welcoming the intruders as a host. Monkman borrows images, themes, and techniques from 18th-century neoclassical painting to create a contemporary version of a history painting. He uses the painting medium to depict the indigenous people as heroes to welcome the colonizers and tries to reintegrate the history of the indigenous people into mainstream Western culture. He believes that the lives, experiences, and destinies of the indigenous people of North America have been distorted by history and should change people's habits of viewing history and the inherent concept of indigenous peoples from the colonists' perspective. Welcoming the Newcomers exposed the colonists' incursion, forcing the indigenous people to accept a new religion and slavery. They went from acceptance to resistance to the colonizers. Monkman satirizes the mental and physical aggression and extermination of indigenous peoples.
