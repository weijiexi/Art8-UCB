- Keeping in mind some of the conventions of landscape and
portraiture that we have looked at, how would you apply the
questions from this list to a work by Wendy Red Star, Kent Monkman,
or James Luna?
- What other questions or perspectives do any of the Indigenous artists
we looked at bring to landscape, portraiture, and history?
