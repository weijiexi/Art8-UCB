# Lecture 5 National Museum of African American History and Culture
##### here are four pillars upon which the NMAAHC stands:
- It provides an opportunity for those who are interested in African American
culture to explore and revel in this history through interactive exhibitions
- It helps all Americans see how their stories, their histories, and their cultures are
shaped and informed by global influences
- It explores what it means to be an American and share how American values like
resiliency, optimism, and spirituality are reflected in African American history and
culture
- It serves as a place of collaboration that reaches beyond Washington, D.C. to
engage new audiences and to work with the myriad of museums and educational
institutions that have explored and preserved this important history well before
this museum was created.

This Museum will tell the American story through the lens of African American
history and culture. This is Americaâ€™s Story and this museum is for all
Americans. Lonnie G. Bunch, III, Founding Director, NMAAHC
