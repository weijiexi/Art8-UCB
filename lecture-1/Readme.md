## WHAT DO MONUMENTS ASK OF US?
### What effect do they have upon us?
- upon our thoughts, ideas, and aspirations?
- upon our behavior?
- How do they help create a sense of a collective (whether a community or a
nation)?
- Who do they include?
- Who do they exclude?
- What do we want from monuments?

- We have seen buildings so far based on ideas of the “classical,”
derived mostly from Greek, Roman (Greco-Roman), and to lesser
extents Egyptian forms; these are further syphoned through Italian
and French forms (neo-classical and beaux arts).
- Buildings as civilizational models based on previous empires.
- Buildings that “speak” to us, that provide an aspirational model

Civic Architecture December 18, 2020 (continued)
- By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States
of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
- Section 1. Purpose. Societies have long recognized the importance of beautiful
public architecture. Ancient Greek and Roman public buildings were designed to
be sturdy and useful, and also to beautify public spaces and inspire civic pride.

- Notable Founding Fathers agreed with these assessments and attached great
importance to Federal civic architecture. They wanted America's public buildings
to inspire the American people and encourage civic virtue. President George
Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson consciously modeled the
most important buildings in Washington, D.C., on the classical architecture of
ancient Athens and Rome. They sought to use classical architecture to visually
connect our contemporary Republic with the antecedents of democracy in
classical antiquity, reminding citizens not only of their rights but also their
responsibilities in maintaining and perpetuating its institutions.
- For example, GSA selected an architect to design the San Francisco Federal
Building who describes his designs as "art-for-art's-sake" architecture, intended
primarily for architects to appreciate. While elite architects praised the resulting
building, many San Franciscans consider it one of the ugliest structures in their
city.
- It is time to update the policies guiding Federal architecture to address these
problems and ensure that architects designing Federal buildings serve their
clients, the American people. New Federal building designs should, like America's
beloved landmark buildings, uplift and beautify public spaces, inspire the human
spirit, ennoble the United States, command respect from the general public, and,
as appropriate, respect the architectural heritage of a region. They should also be
visibly identifiable as civic buildings and should be selected with input from the
local community. Classical and other traditional architecture, as practiced both
historically and by today's architects, have proven their ability to meet these
design criteria and to more than satisfy today's functional, technical, and
sustainable needs. Their use should be encouraged instead of discouraged.
- (c) "Classical architecture" means the architectural tradition derived from the
forms, principles, and vocabulary of the architecture of Greek and Roman
antiquity, and as later developed and expanded upon by such Renaissance
architects as Alberti, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, and Palladio; such
Enlightenment masters as Robert Adam, John Soane, and Christopher Wren; such
19th-century architects as Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Robert Mills, and Thomas U.
Walter; and such 20th-century practitioners as Julian Abele, Daniel Burnham,
Charles F. McKim, John Russell Pope, Julia Morgan, and the firm of Delano and
Aldrich. Classical architecture encompasses such styles as Neoclassical, Georgian,
Federal, Greek Revival, BeauxArts, and Art Deco.
- (e) "General public" means members of the public who are not: (i) artists,
architects, engineers, art or architecture critics, instructors or professors of art or
architecture, or members of the building industry;
